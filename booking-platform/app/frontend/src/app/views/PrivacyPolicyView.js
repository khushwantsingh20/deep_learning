                    <p>
                        At Southern Cross, your privacy is important to us. We are committed to
                        supporting the Australian Privacy Principles and our procedures relating to
                        personal information are designed to ensure that you are fully protected in
                        accordance with our obligations under the Privacy Act 1988 and data
                        protection legislation. When using our services, either online on our
                        website (or related social network sites or applications) or offline, you
                        consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information,
                        but only in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Policy applies to
                        Southern Cross HQLC Pty Ltd (Southern Cross) and related bodies corporate,
                        and was last updated December 2018.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What personal information Southern Cross collects</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the course of providing our services and functions, we collect personal
                        information directly from you, or from a person acting on your behalf. This
                        personal information may include your name, contact numbers, email and
                        mailing address and details of your business. If you access any of our
                        services through a social network site or application including (but not
                        limited to) Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and LinkedIn, we will collect
                        limited information provided to us by that social network site, such as user
                        name, site ID and email address. Without your personal information we may be
                        unable to provide our services to you.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Other information Southern Cross collects</h2>
                    <p>
                        When browsing or searching our website, our server automatically collects
                        navigational data to help us improve our website content and navigation. One
                        way which navigational data is collected is by placing ‘cookies’ in your
                        browser file on your hard drive. A ‘cookie’ is a small amount of information
                        that is transferred to your browser by our web server. The web server that
                        gives you the cookie, is the only web server that can read the cookie again.
                        The cookie therefore serves as a memory for you and can remember such
                        details as your favourite search criteria so you do not have to enter the
                        same information every time you come to our website. Cookies do not capture
                        or track any personal information and by themselves cannot identify you as
                        an individual. If you wish, you may elect not to accept cookies on your
                        browser. This should not adversely affect your experience when visiting our
                        website.
                    </p>

                    <h2>How does Southern Cross collect personal information</h2>
                    <p>
                        We collect your personal information in the course of providing our services
                        and functions to you, including if you select or sign up to any functions on
                        our website or social network sites or applications, complete any online
                        enquiry forms or interact with Southern Cross offline.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Use of personal information</h2>
                    <p>
                        We use your personal information for legitimate purposes only, including: to
                        provide you with the services or information that you have requested from
                        us; to reply to your queries about us and the services and functions that we
                        provide; to develop electronic and hard copy databases, marketing lists,
                        mail-outs, provided you have expressly or impliedly consented to receiving
                        marketing and promotional material via email from us; to improve our website
                        and/or social media sites (based on the information and feedback we receive
                        from you); to improve customer service (new information helps us to more
                        effectively respond to your service requests and support your needs); and to
                        correspond with and notify Southern Cross’s agents when you have expressed
                        interest about one of Peregrine’s projects or made an enquiry.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Direct Marketing</h2>
                    <p>
                        In its reasonable discretion, Southern Cross may include some of your
                        personal information such as your name, contact number, email address and
                        mailing address to our database or a database that belongs to one of our
                        related companies or agents. The databases will be used for marketing
                        purposes only, and includes related companies sending you relevant marketing
                        material in respect of Peregrine’s projects, property related information,
                        services and issues it can assist with. If you wish to unsubscribe from any
                        marketing material received from our related companies, you can either
                        contact the company directly or Peregrine on the details below. You may
                        unsubscribe at any time.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Navigational data</h2>
                    <p>
                        We may use your navigational information by combining it with the
                        navigational information that we have collected about other users. We cannot
                        identify you from that information, instead it gives us aggregated results
                        about the usage of the site. We use the information collected to make this
                        site more user-friendly and to improve the services that we provide.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Disclosure of personal information</h2>
                    <p>
                        We will only disclose your personal information to third parties in certain
                        limited circumstances (including as outlined above). Organisations to which
                        we may disclose information include Southern Cross related bodies corporate,
                        and any agents, consultants, advisers and service providers we work with.
                        Except for Southern Cross’s related companies and agents (as outlined
                        above), we do not provide your information to third parties for them to use
                        to market their products and services to you. From time to time, our website
                        may contain links to other websites, resources and affiliates of Southern
                        Cross, which may have a different privacy policy to us. Accordingly, you
                        should check the privacy policies on their respective websites/applications.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Management of personal information</h2>
                    <p>
                        We understand that security of personal information is important to you. We
                        aim to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we
                        hold about you is not the subject of loss, misuse or unauthorised access or
                        alteration and is accurate and up to date. We also take reasonable steps to
                        destroy or permanently de-identify personal information if we no longer
                        require this information. In some circumstances, however, your information
                        can never be completely destroyed due to legal or accounting requirements or
                        where it is held on a database. Our website does not provide facilities for
                        the secure transmission of information across the internet. You should be
                        aware that there is an inherent risk transmitting information across the
                        internet.

                    <h2>Access to and correction of personal information</h2>
                    <p>
                        We take reasonable steps to ensure that all information we collect, use or
                        disclose about you is accurate, complete and relevant. If you believe that
                        we hold incorrect, incomplete or irrelevant information about you, please
                        notify us and we will endeavor to update the information as soon as
                        possible. You may access your information held by us (subject to some
                        exceptions allowed by law), without charge. If you wish to know what
                        personal information we hold about you or to correct any personal
                        information we hold about you, please contact us by email or phone.

                    <h2>Promotional material via email</h2>
                    <p>
                        You may choose to opt out of our marketing communication activities at any
                        time. If you do not wish to receive emails containing marketing and
                        promotional materials from us, please let us know by emailing Southern Cross
                        directly, being sure to provide us with your name, email and address. We
                        will then remove your name from our marketing lists.
